# Forked: Auto GraphQL Scanner (aka Auto GQL)

This repository is a fork of the original Burp Auto GQL (beta) tool created by Jared Meit. It includes an additional functionality to import the Introspection schema file as an alternative option.

## Usage

Make sure to include the URL of the GraphQL endpoint and the local file path of the introspection schema.json file, load it up and fire it off.

For more information please refer to the original project's [README](https://github.com/FWDSEC/burp-auto-gql) for instructions on how to set up and use Burp Auto GQL. The forked version with the added functionality can be found in this repository.

## Related Talk

The motivation behind the original project and effective usage of Burp Auto GQL is discussed in Jared Meit's talk titled "We Taught Burp To Speak GraphQL: Automated Security Scanning Of Your GraphQL API With Burp" at BSides Toronto.
