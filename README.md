# Forked Project: Auto GraphQL Scanner (aka Auto GQL)

This repository is a fork of the original Burp Auto GQL tool created by Jared Meit. It includes an additional functionality to import a Schema file as an alternative option to Introspection.

## New Functionality: Schema Import

In this fork, we have added the ability to import a Schema file, providing an alternative option to Introspection. This enhancement allows for testing GraphQL APIs that may not expose introspection capabilities.

## Usage

Please refer to the original project's [README](https://github.com/FWDSEC/burp-auto-gql) for instructions on how to set up and use Burp Auto GQL. The forked version with the added functionality can be found in this repository.

## Related Talk

The motivation behind the original project and effective usage of Burp Auto GQL is discussed in Jared Meit's talk titled "We Taught Burp To Speak GraphQL: Automated Security Scanning Of Your GraphQL API With Burp" at BSides Toronto. You can watch the talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR8rLcUcqoU).
